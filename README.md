# -Segmentation---Medical-Chest-X-Ray-Segmentation-
Dataset:*     - The dataset contains chest X-ray images with corresponding segmentation masks. The goal is to perform binary segmentation to identify lung regions.
This project implements a U-Net deep learning model to perform automatic lung segmentation on chest X-ray (CXR) images. The goal is to accurately identify and isolate lung regions from CXR scans, which is a critical step in medical image analysis for diagnosing respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, and COVID-19.
